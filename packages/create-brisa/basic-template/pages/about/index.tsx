            Brisa makes it easy to build web applications by combining server
            components with server actions, web components with JSX, signals,
            and server-side rendering.
          </p>
          <p>
            We leverage "action signals," inspired by HTMX, to enhance
            communication between server and client.
          </p>
          <p>
            Brisa also empowers the community to create and share new web
            component libraries.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's the only framework offering full internationalization support.
            Also it comes with an integrated test runner.
          </p>
          <p>
            With Brisa, you can run your project in various JavaScript runtimes,
            export static files, combine static and dynamic pages, or even build
            desktop, Android, or iOS apps.
