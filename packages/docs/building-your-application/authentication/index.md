# Authentication

To incorporate authentication in Brisa, acquaint yourself with three fundamental principles:

- **[Authentication](/building-your-application/authentication/authentication) (Identity Verification)** ensures the user's claimed identity. It mandates users to validate their identity with possessions like a username and password.
- **[Authorization](/building-your-application/authentication/authorization)** determines the application areas accessible to the user..
- **[Session Tracking](/building-your-application/authentication/session-tracking)** monitors the user's status (e.g., logged in) across various requests.

This page illustrates the utilization of Brisa features to implement prevalent patterns in authentication, authorization, and session management. This empowers you to select optimal solutions tailored to your application's requirements.
