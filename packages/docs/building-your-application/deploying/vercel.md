# Vercel

To deploy to Vercel, use [adapter-vercel](https://github.com/brisa-build/brisa/blob/main/packages/adapter-vercel).

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> In Vercel instead of using [Bun](https://bun.sh/) runtime is going to use the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and/or [Edge](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/edge-functions) runtime.

## Usage

Install with:

```sh
bun install -D brisa/adapter-vercel
```

Then, add the adapter to your `brisa.config.ts`:

```ts
/// file: brisa.config.ts
import vercel from 'brisa/adapter-vercel';

export default {
  outputAdapter: vercel({
    // see below for options that can be set here
  })
};
```

## Deployment configuration

To control how your routes are deployed to Vercel as functions, you can specify deployment configuration, either through the option shown above or with [`export const config`](page-options#config) inside `src/pages` or `src/layout` files.

> [!WARNING]
>
> By specifying `config` inside a layout, it applies to all child pages.

For example you could deploy some parts of your app as [Edge Functions](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/edge-functions)...

```ts
/// file: src/pages/about.tsx
/** @type {import('brisa/adapter-vercel').Config} */
export const config = {
	runtime: 'edge'
};
```

...and others as [Serverless Functions](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/serverless-functions):

```ts
/// file: admin/+layout.js
/** @type {import('brisa/adapter-vercel').Config} */
export const config = {
	runtime: 'nodejs18.x'
};
```

The following options apply to all functions:

- `runtime`: `'edge'`, `'nodejs18.x'` or `'nodejs20.x'`. By default, the adapter will select the `'nodejs<version>.x'` corresponding to the Node version your project is configured to use on the Vercel dashboard
- `regions`: an array of [edge network regions](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/edge-network/regions) (defaulting to `["iad1"]` for serverless functions) or `'all'` if `runtime` is `edge` (its default). Note that multiple regions for serverless functions are only supported on Enterprise plans
- `split`: if `true`, causes a route to be deployed as an individual function. If `split` is set to `true` at the adapter level, all routes will be deployed as individual functions

Additionally, the following option applies **only** to **edge** functions:
- `external`: an array of dependencies that esbuild should treat as external when bundling functions. This should only be used to exclude optional dependencies that will not run outside Node

And the following option apply **only** to **serverless functions**:
- `memory`: the amount of memory available to the function. Defaults to `1024` Mb, and can be decreased to `128` Mb or [increased](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/limits/overview#serverless-function-memory) in 64Mb increments up to `3008` Mb on Pro or Enterprise accounts
- `maxDuration`: [maximum execution duration](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/runtimes#max-duration) of the function. Defaults to `10` seconds for Hobby accounts, `15` for Pro and `900` for Enterprise
- `isr`: configuration Incremental Static Regeneration, described below

If your functions need to access data in a specific region, it's recommended that they be deployed in the same region (or close to it) for optimal performance.

## Image Optimization

You may set the `images` config to control how Vercel builds your images. See the [image configuration reference](https://vercel.com/docs/build-output-api/v3/configuration#images) for full details. As an example, you may set:

```ts
/// file: brisa.config.ts
import vercel from 'brisa/adapter-vercel';

export default {
	outputAdapter: vercel({
    images: {
      sizes: [640, 828, 1200, 1920, 3840],
      formats: ['image/avif', 'image/webp'],
      minimumCacheTTL: 300,
      domains: ['example-app.vercel.app'],
    }
  })
};
```

## Incremental Static Regeneration

Vercel supports [Incremental Static Regeneration](https://vercel.com/docs/incremental-static-regeneration) (ISR), which provides the performance and cost advantages of prerendered content with the flexibility of dynamically rendered content.

To add ISR to a route, include the `isr` property in your `config` object:

```tsx
export const config = {
	isr: {
		// Expiration time (in seconds) before the cached asset will be
		// re-generated by invoking the Serverless Function.
		// Setting the value to `false` means it will never expire.
		expiration: 60,

		// Random token that can be provided in the URL to bypass the cached
		// version of the asset, by requesting the asset
		// with a __prerender_bypass=<token> cookie.
		//
		// Making a `GET` or `HEAD` request with `x-prerender-revalidate: 
		// <token>` will force the asset to be re-validated.
		bypassToken: process.env.BYPASS_TOKEN,

		// List of valid query parameters. Other parameters (such as utm
		// tracking codes) will be ignored,
		// ensuring that they do not result in content being regenerated
		// unnecessarily
		allowQuery: ['search']
	}
};
```

The `expiration` property is required; all others are optional.

## Environment variables

Vercel makes a set of [deployment-specific environment variables](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/environment-variables#system-environment-variables) available. Like other environment variables, these are accessible from `process.env`.

## Skew protection

[Skew protection](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/skew-protection) is a Vercel feature that routes client requests to their original deployment. When a user visits your app, a cookie is set with the deployment ID, and any subsequent requests will be routed to that deployment for as long as skew protection is active. When they reload the page, they will get the newest deployment.
