# External Libraries

When working on a Brisa project, you may encounter scenarios where you need to integrate external libraries. This documentation outlines the process of installing and using external libraries in different contexts within your project: standalone libraries, server components, and web components.

## Common Installation

For all types of libraries, including standalone, server components, and web components, you can use the `bun install` command to install them. This command fetches and installs the library, making it available for use throughout your project.

```bash
bun install <library-name>
```

## Standalone Libraries

### Import and Usage

Once installed, you can import the library wherever needed in your project and use its functionalities accordingly.

```ts
import myLibrary from "<library-name>";

// Use library functions or classes as needed, whether inside web components, server components, middleware, etc.
```

This addition emphasizes the versatility of standalone libraries, making it clear that developers can utilize them in various parts of their project, depending on the specific needs of each component type.

## Server Components Dependencies

### Import and Usage

When dealing with server components, import the library and use its functionalities within your server-side code:

```tsx
import ServerComponent from "<server-component-library>";

export default function MyPage() {
  // Use server components as needed inside the JSX
  return <ServerComponent />;
}
```

While both server components and web components can leverage external libraries, the key distinction lies in how they are used. In server components, the integration is more straightforward, as you can directly import and use the libraries within JSX.

## Web Components Dependencies

### Import and Usage

To integrate a web component library, create a file named `web-components/_integrations.(tsx|ts|js|jsx)`.

Export an object where each key is the selector of the web component, and the corresponding value is the path (in string format) to the library, similar to what you would use in an import statement.

```ts
export default {
  "custom-element": "<library-path>",
  // Add more mappings as needed
};
```

Usage of web components within server components does not require additional imports. Simply include the web component tags directly in your server component code:

```tsx
// Inside a server component or inside another web-component
<div>
  <custom-element></custom-element>
</div>
```

This approach allows seamless integration of web components within your server components, maintaining a clean and concise code structure.

> [!NOTE]
> This dynamic loading approach allows seamless integration of web components within your server components, optimizing the performance by loading only the necessary libraries when they are required.

**Note for Developers:** The web components specified in `web-components/_integrations` will be dynamically included in the client-side code only when they are used on a particular page. This behavior ensures optimal loading, preventing unnecessary libraries from being carried until they are explicitly required by the page.

### Third party Brisa web components vs native web components

For both, you can use the `web-components/_integrations.(tsx|ts|js|jsx)`:

```ts
export default {
  "brisa-element": "<library-path>",
  "native-web-component": "<library-path>",
};
```

As a note for those who create open-source libraries, the difference is that if there is a default export, it interprets it as a Brisa web component, so you can create any Brisa library with it:

```tsx
export default function BrisaElement() {
  return <div>My Brisa Element</div>;
}
```

However, if you want to create a native web component, you don't need to export it, and you can use the `customElements.define` method:

```tsx
customElements.define(
  "native-web-component",
  class extends HTMLElement {
    connectedCallback() {
      this.innerHTML = "My Native Web Component";
    }
  },
);
```

There are some benefits using Brisa web components over native web components, such as the ability to use [Declarative Shadow DOM](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/css-ui/declarative-shadow-dom) ([SSR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-side_scripting#Server-side_rendering) for web components) and type-safety of props.

However, for both, you also have benefits, such as that the web component is only loaded in the page that consumes it, and type-safe of the element name is activated inside your JSX.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> **About the definition of the name:** in the Brisa web components as they are not yet defined, you can put the name you want to use, while as the native ones are already defined, you have to put the exact match of the name of the element that defines the library.
