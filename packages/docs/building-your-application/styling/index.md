# Styling

Brisa supports different ways of styling your application, including:

- **Global CSS**: Simple to use and familiar for those experienced with traditional CSS, but can lead to larger CSS bundles and difficulty managing styles as the application grows.
- **CSS Modules**: Create locally scoped CSS classes to avoid naming conflicts and improve maintainability.
- **CSS template string**: Useful for creating reactive styles to signals within web components.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid custom designs by composing utility classes.

Learn more about each approach by exploring their respective documentation:
