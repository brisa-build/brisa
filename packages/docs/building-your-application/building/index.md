# Building

Congratulations, it's time to build your application in production.

## Production Builds

Running `brisa build` generates an optimized version of your application for production. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files are created based on your pages. JavaScript is **compiled** and browser bundles are **minified** using the [Bun Compiler](https://bun.sh/docs/bundler) to help achieve the best performance.

### Bun Server

Brisa can be deployed to any hosting provider that supports Bun. Ensure your `package.json` has the `"build"` and `"start"` scripts:

```json filename="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "brisa dev",
    "build": "brisa build",
    "start": "brisa start"
  }
}
```

Then, run `bun run build` to build your application. Finally, run `bun run start` to start the Bun server. This server supports all Brisa features.

## App Strategy (Static, Server, Desktop, Android, iOS)

Brisa supports multiple [output](/building-your-application/configuring/output) strategies to build your application. You can choose between:

- [Build a Web Service App](/building-your-application/building/web-service-app)
- [Build a Static Site App](/building-your-application/building/static-site-app)
- [Build a Desktop App](/building-your-application/building/desktop-app)
- [Build a Android App](/building-your-application/building/android-app)
- [Build a iOS App](/building-your-application/building/ios-app)
