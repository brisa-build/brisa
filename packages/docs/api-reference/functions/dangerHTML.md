# dangerHTML

## Reference

### `dangerHTML(html: string): DangerHTMLOutput`

Make situations that we want to inject HTML that we have in string to the DOM. For these occasions, you can use the `dangerHTML` function. Since without this function it is escaped by security.

```tsx
import { dangerHTML } from "brisa";

export default function SomeComponent() {
  return (
    <>
      {/* Escaped by default (doesn't work for security): */}
      {'<script>alert("This is escaped and is not going to work")</script>'}

      {/* Force to inject an string as HTML: */}
      {dangerHTML(
        '<script>alert("This is injected and is going to work")</script>',
      )}
    </>
  );
}
```

#### Parameters:

- `html`: The HTML code in string that you want to inject.

#### Returns:

- `DangerHTMLOutput` It is a JSX element type that Brisa JSX-runtime understands as an element.
