In this first version after 0.1, we have fixed some errors in the documentation and fixed some types. In addition, we have added a couple of new features:

- [PandaCSS integration](https://brisa.build/building-your-application/styling/panda-css): Now you can use PandaCSS in Brisa, you have the [example](https://brisa.build/examples) to try.
- [Configuration to filter runtime development errors](https://brisa.build/building-your-application/configuring/filter-runtime-dev-errors): Now you can filter development errors at runtime, so they are not displayed in the console.
