title: Web Components
description: Understand how to use web-components in Brisa.
---

Remember that everything in Brisa (pages, layout, middleware, api...) runs on the server.

The page components are server-components. However, we support a connection to the [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components) through the `src/web-components` folder.

Web Components is a suite of different technologies allowing you to create reusable custom elements — with their functionality encapsulated away from the rest of your code — and utilize them in the rest of the app.

Similar to the pages, the file names will be the names of the web components. There is no routing here, but you have to take this into account when adding the names.

```sh
.
└── web-components
    ├── form
    │   └── error-feedback.tsx
    ├── sidebar-menu.tsx
    └── user-card.tsx
```

They can now be used directly as HTML tags in the rest of the web-components and server-components:

```jsx
<body>
  <sidebar-menu />
  <user-card />
  <form>
    <input type="text" />
    <form-error-feedback />
    <button>Submit</button>
  </form>
</body>
```

We support type-safe, so TypeScript can make your life easier when using them.

## Differences with Server Components

In order to make it easy during development, we support the fact that creating web-components is very similar to the rest of the components (Brisa mode). However there are some differences.

Although the server components are interactive in Brisa, the interactivity of the server components is more focused on interactivity where the server is involved. It would not make sense to do the interactivity on the server for Spreadsheet cell components, since all this interactivity could be on the client avoiding constant calls to the server.

Web components are fully reactive thanks to [signals](#state-state-method). There are no rerenders, no virtual DOM and no reconciliation.

And of course, unlike Server Components, you can access the [Web API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API):

```tsx
import { WebContext } from "brisa";

export default function SomeWebComponent({}, { onMount, cleanup }: WebContext) {
  onMount(() => document.addEventListener("scroll", onScroll));
  cleanup(() => document.removeEventListener("scroll", onScroll));

  function onScroll(event) {
    // some implementation of the scroll event
  }

  return <div>{/* some content */}</div>;
}
```

In the last example, the scroll event is recorded when the web component is mounted and deleted when the web component is unmounted.

## Creating a Web Component

### Step 1: Create the file

Unlike Server Components that can be created anywhere, web components must be inside the `src/web-component` folder. For example, let's create this file: `src/web-component/some-example.tsx`.

Here the **file name** is very important, since it will be the name of the web-component selector. That is, we will be able to use it in other web/server components with the tag:

```tsx
<some-example>Some example</some-example>
```

The names of the Web Components, as a convention, must be created in [**kebab-case**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Kebab_case) and at least 2 batches to avoid conflicts with other elements of the web. However, you can group them in folders.

| Route                                        | Correct | `selector`                 |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------- | -------------------------- |
| `src/web-component/some-example.tsx`         | ✅      | `<some-example/>`          |
| `src/web-component/some/example.tsx`         | ✅      | `<some-example/>`          |
| `src/web-component/some-complex-example.tsx` | ✅      | `<some-complex-example />` |
| `src/web-component/SomeExample.tsx`          | ❌      | -                          |
| `src/web-component/someExample.tsx`          | ❌      | -                          |
| `src/web-component/some_complex-example.tsx` | ❌      | -                          |
| `src/web-component/some_complex/example.tsx` | ❌      | -                          |
| `src/web-component/some.tsx`                 | ❌      | -                          |

### Step 2: Write and `export default` the component

Once we have created the file, we can write our Web Component. The only thing we need to do to make it available is to make a `export default` of the component.

```tsx
export default function HelloWorld() {
  return <div>Hello World</div>;
}
```

## Props

Brisa components use _props_ to communicate with each other. Every parent component can pass some information to its child components by giving them props. Props might remind you of HTML attributes, but you can pass any JavaScript value through them, including objects, arrays, and functions.

The properties are signals but can be used directly without using the `.value`, because they are readonly.

> **Good to know**: Since props are signals, consume them directly or use [`derived`](#derived-state-and-props-derived-method) method. Doing so breaks the reactivity:
>
> ```tsx
> export default function UserImages({ urls }, { derived }) {
>   // ❌ variable is no longer reactive
>   const firstImage = urls[0];
>   // ✅ Instead, use derived:
>   const reactiveFirstImage = derived(() => urls[0]);
> }
> ```

### Step 1: Pass props to the child component

First, pass some props to `user-images`. For example, let’s pass three props: urls (array of strings), width and height (number):

`src/web-components/user-info.tsx`:

```tsx
export default function UserInfo() {
  return (
    <user-images
      urls={["some-image.jpg", "another-url.jpg"]}
      width={300}
      height={300}
    />
  );
}
```

Now you can read these props inside the `user-images` component.

### Step 2: Read props inside the child component

You can read these props by listing their names `urls`, `width`, `height` separated by the commas inside `({` and `})` directly after `function UserImages`. This lets you use them inside the `UserImages` code, like you would with a variable.

`src/web-components/user-images.tsx`:

```tsx
export default function UserImages({ urls, width, height }) {
  // urls, width and height are available here
  return urls.map((imageUrl) => (
    <img
      class="avatar"
      src={imageUrl}
      alt="probably we can add this 'alt' to prop also"
      width={width}
      height={height}
    />
  ));
}
```

### Specifying a default value for a prop

If you want to give a prop a default value to fall back on when no value is specified, you can do it with the destructuring by putting `=` and the default value right after the parameter:

```tsx
export default function UserImages({ urls = [], width = 300, height = 300 }) {
  // ...
}
```

Adding defaults in this way does not break reactivity.

## Children

In Brisa, the children prop is a special prop that allows components to pass elements, components, or even plain text as children to another component. It provides a flexible way to compose and structure Brisa applications.

The children prop is implicitly available and can be accessed as an argument. Let's take a look at a simple example:

`src/web-components/my-component.tsx`:

```tsx
const MyComponent = ({ children }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>This is my component</p>
      {children}
    </div>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

`src/web-components/parent-component.tsx`:

```tsx
const ParentComponent = () => {
  return (
    <my-component>
      <p>These are the child components!</p>
    </my-component>
  );
};

export default ParentComponent;
```

In this example, the `my-component` component can render its content and any child components passed to it using the children prop.

However, Web-components, by their nature, have the possibility to use the [`slot` tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/slot) also to define children. You can use it in case you need **more than one child**. The prop `children` is an equivalent to an unnamed slot.

This is **also valid**:

`src/web-components/my-component-using-slots.tsx`:

```tsx
const MyComponentUsingSlots = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>This is my component with slots</p>
      <div>
        <slot name="header"></slot>
      </div>
      <div>
        <slot name="content"></slot>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default MyComponentUsingSlots;
```

`src/web-components/parent-component-using-slots.tsx`:

```tsx
const ParentComponentUsingSlots = () => {
  return (
    <my-component-using-slots>
      <div slot="header">Header Content</div>
      <p slot="content">These are the child components!</p>
    </my-component-using-slots>
  );
};

export default ParentComponentUsingSlots;
```

## Events

### Events via attributes

In Brisa Web Components there is a convention that events must start with `on` prefix. Ex: `onNext`, `onPrev`. This convention is because it is necessary to distinguish between attributes that are events and those that are not. And as the functions cannot serialize, we came to make this convention. After following this convention you can use events in Web Components as if you were in other frameworks such as React.

`src/web-components/color-selector.tsx`:

```tsx
import { WebContext } from "brisa";

export default function ColorSelector({ color, onChangeColor }: WebContext) {
  return (
    <div>
      <input
        type="color"
        value={color}
        onInput={(e: any) => onChangeColor(e.target.value)}
      />
      <span style={{ color }}>{color}</span>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Consuming the event `onChangeColor` of this Web Component from another component:

`src/web-components/color-circle.tsx`:

```tsx
import { WebContext } from "brisa";

export default function ColorSVG({}: any, { state }: WebContext) {
  const color = state<string>("#ff0000");

  return (
    <>
      <b>Select a color: </b>
      <color-selector
        color={color.value}
        onChangeColor={(newColor: string) => (color.value = newColor)}
      />

      <svg width="12cm" height="12cm" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
        <circle
          cx="6cm"
          cy="2cm"
          r="100"
          fill={color.value}
          transform="translate(0,50)"
        />
      </svg>
    </>
  );
}
```

### DOM events

As web components are DOM elements, they also automatically have their own events. You can capture an `onClick` of any Web Component without the need to implement it inside:

```tsx
<color-selector
  color={color.value}
  onClick={(e) => console.log("onClick event already work? 🤯", e)}
  onChangeColor={(newColor: string) => (color.value = newColor)}
/>
```

> **Good to know**: It is important to know this when naming events that do not conflict with [existing DOM events](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/dom_obj_event.asp), to avoid "event fires twice" issues. Also important if you want to overwrite a DOM event, use the [`e.stopPropagation()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/stopPropagation) to avoid the conflict.

### Events on `ref`

You can register an event after accessing an element with the `ref` attribute and `state`:

```tsx
export default ({}, { onMount, cleanup, state }: WebContext) => {
  const ref = state(null);

  function onClick(e) {
    console.log("Event via ref", e);
  }

  onMount(() => ref.value.addEventListener("click", onClick));
  cleanup(() => ref.value.removeEventListener("click", onClick));

  return <div ref={ref}>Example</div>;
};
```

Although we recommend registering events via attributes, we also provide the opportunity to do it this way. The grace of the `ref` is also that you can have control of the element after mounting, thing that also allows to register events in it.

> **Good to know**: For the `ref` attribute you do not have to put the `.value`, you have to put the whole state.

## State (`state` method)

The state is under a signal. This means that to consume it you have to use the `.value` clause.

### Example:

`src/web-components/counter-component.tsx`:

```tsx
import { WebContext } from "brisa";

export default function Counter({}, { state }: WebContext) {
  // Declaring state
  const count = state<number>(0);

  // Setting state:
  const inc = () => count.value++;
  const dec = () => count.value--;

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={inc}>+</button>
      {/* Consuming state: */}
      <span> Counter: {count.value} </span>
      <button onClick={dec}>-</button>
    </>
  );
}
```

Whenever a state mutate (change the `.value`) reactively updates these parts of the DOM where the signal has been set.

## Effects (`effect` method)

Effects are used to record side effects such as fetching data, setting up a subscription, and manually changing the DOM in Brisa components.

Each effect is executed immediately upon registration and also every time a registered signal within the effect changes. There is no need to write the dependencies of these signals separately, since the effect is smart enough to detect the signals.

```tsx
export default ({ foo }: { foo: string }, { effect }: WebContext) => {
  effect(() => {
    if (foo === "bar") {
      console.log("foo now is bar");
    }
  });

  return <div>Example</div>;
};
```

This would be an example using a prop called `foo`. The props are signals readonly, that's why it doesn't have the `.value`.

You can also use async-await in effects:

```tsx
export default ({ foo }: { foo: string }, { state, effect }: WebContext) => {
  const bar = state<any>();

  effect(async () => {
    if (foo === "bar") {
      bar.value = await fetch(/* some endpoint */).then((r) => r.json());
    }
  });

  return bar.value && <div>{bar.value.someField}</div>;
};
```

## Clean effects (`cleanup` method)

## Derived state and props (`derived` method)

## Context

Web Components do not have access to the [`request context`](/docs/building-your-application/data-fetching/request-context) directly as they are executed on the client. If they need something from the request context, it has to be passed as a parameter.

To share context between Web Components without prop drilling you can use the web context.

## Using Web Components in Server Components

We are not going to use any import, we can consume it directly as another HTML tag.

Example consuming a Web Component inside a Server Component:

```tsx filename="src/components/using-web-component.tsx" switcher
import { RequestContext } from "brisa";
import AnotherServerComponent from "./another";

type Props = { name: string };

export function ServerComponent(
  { name }: Props,
  requestContext: RequestContext
) {
  return (
    <div>
      {/* This is the Web Component, no import need it, is like more HTML tags */}
      <some-web-component name={name}>
        <AnotherServerComponent name={name} />
      </some-web-component>
    </div>
  );
}
```

```js filename="src/components/using-web-component.js" switcher
import AnotherServerComponent from "./another";

export function ServerComponent({ name }, requestContext) {
  return (
    <div>
      {/* This is the Web Component, no import need it, is like more HTML tags */}
      <some-web-component name={name}>
        <AnotherServerComponent name={name} />
      </some-web-component>
    </div>
  );
}
```
