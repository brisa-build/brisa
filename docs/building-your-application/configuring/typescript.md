Brisa provides a TypeScript-first development experience for building your application.

It comes with built-in TypeScript support for automatically installing the necessary packages and configuring the proper settings thanks to [Bun](https://bun.sh/docs/runtime/typescript).

`bun create brisa` ships with TypeScript by default.

```bash filename="Terminal"
bun create brisa
```
